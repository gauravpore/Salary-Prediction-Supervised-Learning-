Linear Regression Theory:
The term “linearity” in algebra refers to a linear relationship between two or more variables. If we draw this relationship in a two-dimensional space (between two variables), we get a straight line.
Linear regression performs the task to predict a dependent variable value (y) based on a given independent variable (x). So, this regression technique finds out a linear relationship between x (input) and y(output). Hence, the name is Linear Regression. If we plot the independent variable (x) on the x-axis and dependent variable (y) on the y-axis, linear regression gives us a straight line that best fits the data points.
